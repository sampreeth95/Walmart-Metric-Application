      •	Product (Creates product instances for storing to products)
      •	User_Metric (Creates user instances with the given metrics)
    ### Utils (Package for common utilities for database creation, string generation, validation)
      •	DatabaseConnection (Makes connection with Azure DB)
      •	Scheduler (Runs user metrics at scheduled time Interval)
      •	StringGen (Generates random strings for product names)
      •	Validation (Business logic to validate user Metrics)
    ### App (Class for initiating application).

## NOTE:
  Designed Scheduler thread which checks for outlier every 15 secs
  Adding random products for every 30 secs.
  Checking outliers for every 15 secs.
